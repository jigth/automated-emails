# automated-emails

System that automates email sending by using some SaaS's API.

In this case I'm using [Sendinblue](https://sendinblue.com/) because it's free and it has great documentation. But this can be extended to use different "mail SaaS providers".

I recommend using PNPM package manager for the next steps because it's faster. Both "NPM" and "PNPM" have the same syntax (except that one starts with 'npm' and the other with 'pnpm') for the following instruction so feel free to use either one.

## Install

npm i

## Build

npm run build

## Test

npm run test

## Test Watch (Keep watching the tests when you're working on them!)

npm run test:watch
